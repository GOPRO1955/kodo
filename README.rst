KODO Library
============

Introduction
------------

**Kodo** is a flexible C++ network coding, intended to be used for commercial applications and for research on implementation of Network Coding. The library enable researchers to implement, new codes and algorithms, perform simulations, and benchmark the coding operations on any platform where a C++ compiler is available. The library provide a multitude of build blocks and parameters that can be combined in order to create codes. To ensure ease of use several codes are predefined, and high level API's provided.


Building
--------
Run::
    ./waf configure
    ./waf build

Examples
