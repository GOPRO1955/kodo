/// @defgroup fec_stacks FEC Stacks
/// @brief The ready assembled stacks the functionality in a stack is
///        typically some type of FEC code e.g. Network Code or
///        Reed-Solomon code.

/// @defgroup debug Debug Functionality
/// @brief Layers / stacks that implements various debugging functionalities.
///        Typically useful when implementing new codes or when monitoring
///        the performance of the coding algorithms.

/// @defgroup empty Empty Implementations
/// @brief Layers that provide an empty implementation of a specific API. This
///        is useful when writing unit-test, but can also be used if a specific
///        API must be provided but remains unused by the implementation.
