\subsection{Detailed Description}
The symbol id describes how an encoded symbol has been produced. The symbol id uniquely describes the coding coefficients which are used by the encoder to create an encoded symbol as linear combinations of a set of original source symbols. By transmitting the symbol id to the decoder it can re-\/create the coding coefficients used to generate the encoded symbol and by solving a linear system re-\/produce the original source symbols. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In its simplest from the symbol id is the actual coding coefficients. This type of symbol id is produced by the \hyperlink{}{kodo\-::random\-\_\-uniform\-\_\-symbol\-\_\-id} class. However for efficiency reasons you may want to limit the amount of data transmitted between an encoder and decoder by transmitting a smaller id. One example of this is to use the \hyperlink{}{which only transmits the seed for the pseudo-\/random number generator used to generate the coding coefficients.  In Network Coding applications the symbol id is often referred to as the encoding vector. }
