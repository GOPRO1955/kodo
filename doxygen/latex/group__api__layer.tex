\subsection{Detailed Description}
Provides an overview of the A\-P\-Is implemented by different components in Kodo. Kodo is built using a C++ design technique called Mixin-\/\-Layers. Mixin-\/\-Layers is a flexible way of separating functionality into reusable building blocks (called layers).

At each layer a separate A\-P\-I is specified and in order to customize or add functionality to Kodo it is necessary to understand which A\-P\-I layer to look at.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
That is by no means required that a specific encoder and decoder utilize or provide all A\-P\-I layers. The A\-P\-I layers main purpose is to facilitate re-\/use between implementations of different encoders and decoders.
\end{DoxyNote}
If you wish to get a better understanding of the layering technique used, you may take a look at the mixin\-\_\-example.

Before showing the typical layered structure of an encoder and decoder implemented in Kodo is ...
