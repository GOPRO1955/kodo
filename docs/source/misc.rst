On this page we collect miscellaneous information about the Kodo project.

Using Kodo for your research
----------------------------
One of initial reasons for building Kodo was to make a tool for doing
research into erasure correcting codes, with a specific focus on network
codes. So if you have used or plan to use Kodo for your research we would
love to hear about it :)

If you are doing a publication using Kodo, all we ask is that you cite our
work. Find the pdf and bibtex of the initial `Kodo paper here`_.

Version Numbering
-----------------
In Steinwurf we use `Semantic versioning`_ for our projects. Semantic
versioning is a very simple scheme built around the x.y.z concept
(for example 2.6.0).

.. _Semantic versioning: http://semver.org/

The basic rules we use are the following:
 * Major version: Increment x when you break backwards-compatibility or add major features
 * Minor version: Increment y when you add a new feature (without breaking
   backward-compatibility)
 * Bug fix: Increment z when you fix something e.g. a bug (without breaking
   backward-compatibility)
