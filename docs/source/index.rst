==================

Welcome to the Kodo Network Coding library documentation.

Kodo is a C++ library for implementing Erasure Correcting Codes in particular
Network Codes. The library is intended to be used for reliable communication
protocols and systems and for research on implementation of Network Codes.

.. The library enable researchers to implement, new codes and algorithms, perform simulations,
.. and benchmark the coding operations on any platform where a C++ compiler is
.. available. The library provide a multitude of build blocks and parameters that
.. can be combined in order to create codes. To ensure ease of use several codes
.. are predefined, and high level API's provided.
