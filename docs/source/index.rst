Kodo documentation
==================

Welcome to the Kodo Network Coding library documentation. On these pages you
will find the information you need to start using Kodo for your research or
educational purposes.

About
-----
**Kodo** is a flexible C++ network coding, intended to be used for commercial
applications and for research on implementation of Network Coding. The library
enable researchers to implement, new codes and algorithms, perform simulations,
and benchmark the coding operations on any platform where a C++ compiler is
available. The library provide a multitude of build blocks and parameters that
can be combined in order to create codes. To ensure ease of use several codes
are predefined, and high level API's provided.

Hello Kodo
----------
Although we aim for high performance in Kodo we also strive for an easy-to-use
API to illustrate this, the following example shows how to encode and decode a
block of data.




Overview
--------
We have divided the documentation of Kodo into two parts one part for user that
are mostly interested in integrating and using the features of Kodo in an their
own projects, and one part for developers who are interested in contributing
code to Kodo library.
